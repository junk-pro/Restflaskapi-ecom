# Restflaskapi-ecom
A flask API to do basic functions for an online store
Adding, deleting products and autheticating users

To use this project best possible way would be to create a virtual environment in your system and then copy the code from app.py and run app.py from the command prompt.
I would advice to download all the necessary files which have been mostly clubbed in the requirements.txt.
For testing best possible thing would be to use postman.
